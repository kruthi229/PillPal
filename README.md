PillPal

PillPal is a smart medication ordering and scheduling system designed to simplify the process of purchasing and managing medicines for users. The project automates the connection between users and medicine sellers (pharmacies) by collecting medication requirements and sending purchase requests via email on behalf of the user.

Core Functionalities:

1. User Input Collection:

Users provide details of the required medicines, including:

-Medicine name

-Dosage (e.g., 500mg)

-Quantity required

-Consumption schedule (e.g., twice daily, after meals)

2. Email Ordering:
Once the user submits their medication request, PillPal automatically generates and sends an email to the designated medicine seller or pharmacy based on the user input.
The email contains the complete order details, ensuring accurate communication between the user and seller.

Purpose and Impact:

PillPal bridges the gap between patients and pharmacies by removing the hassle of manual ordering. It ensures:

-Easier and faster medicine procurement.

-Reduced chances of miscommunication with pharmacies.

-Improved adherence to medication schedules through clear instructions and reminders.
